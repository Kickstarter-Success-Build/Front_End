**Summary:**

The dataset we worked on for this application comes from Kaggle and it is from 2017,
and it contains about 200k projects. Also, it contains the 4000 most successful
kickstarters. Anyway, the majority of the projects failed which is unfortunate.
Kickstarter receives billions every year in pledges from thousands of backers
to fund projects. This app predicts who were successful and those that failed by
just entering their statement. To be successful, however, it means they got funded.
Even more so past the asking funding amount.

**Application usage:**

- You want to predict if a Kickstarter you're planning to invest in might fail or succeed.
- You want to test your Kickstarter statement and find out if you get a successful output.
