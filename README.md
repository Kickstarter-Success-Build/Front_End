# Kickstarter Success Prediction

            The dataset we worked on for this application comes from Kaggle and it is from 2017,
            and it contains about 200k projects. Also, it contains the 4000 most successful
            kickstarters. Anyway, the majority of the projects failed which is unfortunate.
            Kickstarter receives billions every year in pledges from thousands of backers
            to fund projects. This app predicts who were successful and those that failed by
            just entering their statement. To be successful, however, it means they got funded.
            Even more so past the asking funding amount.
